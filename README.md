# Not a Smartboard

## Description
Our product aims to be a tool to help developers during peer code review sessions. Rather than screen shares, it allows for a more immersive and interactive way to provide feedback. The product allows developers to upload a desired code file and project it onto a whiteboard or equivalent. This allows reviewers to handwrite comments, which will all be captured and saved, allowing the feedback process to be smooth and efficient, especially in group environments.
